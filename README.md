# CaseOhMouse
Makes your mouse super heavy. Gives your mouse gravity and momentum. Shakes windows when open. Can grab onto windows and summon ropes to help you with your constant gravity.

use 'end' key to terminate the program
use 'PG UP' to toggle on and off
use 'shift' to spawn a rope that will break under your weight for too long
click and hold over a window to grip onto it, after some time you will start to loose grip and the window will eventually fall under your weight. 

The python code was provided so you can mess with it yourself, just please don't take it and market it as your own
